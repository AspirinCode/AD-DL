## About the project

This repository contains a software framework for reproducible experiments with
convolutional neural networks (CNN) on **automatic classification of Alzheimer's
disease (AD) using anatomical MRI data** from the publicly available dataset
ADNI. 
The journal version of the paper describing the algorithmes here implemented
can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101694).

Automatic Classification of AD using a classical machine learning approach can
be performed using the software available here:
<https://github.com/aramis-lab/AD-ML>.

This software is currently in **active development**. If you find a problem
when using it, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/aramis-lab/ad-dl/issues).

Pretrained models for the CNN networks can be obtained here:
<https://zenodo.org/record/3491003>

## How to install `clinicadl` ?

### Create a conda environment with the corresponding dependencies:
Keep the following order of the installation instructions.
It guaranties the right management of libraries depending on common packages:


```
conda create --name clinicadl_env python=3.6 pytorch torchvision -c pytorch

conda activate clinicadl_env
git clone git@github.com:aramis-lab/AD-DL.git
cd AD-DL
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install the package `clinicadl` as developer in the active conda environment:

```
cd clinicadl
pip install -e .
```

## How to use `clinicadl` ?

`clinicadl` is an utility to be used with the command line.

To have an overview of the general options proposed by the software type: 

```bash
clinicadl -h

usage: clinicadl [-h] [--verbose]
{generate,preprocessing,extract,train,classify} ...

Clinica Deep Learning.

optional arguments:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
--verbose, -v

Task to execute with clinicadl:
  What kind of task do you want to use with clinicadl? (preprocessing,
  extract, generate, train, validate, classify).

    {generate,preprocessing,extract,train,classify}
                        Tasks proposed by clinicadl
    generate            Generate synthetic data for functional tests.
    preprocessing       Prepare data for training (needs clinica installed).
    extract             Create data (slices or patches) for training.
    train               Train with your data and create a model.
    classify            Classify one image or a list of images with your
                        previously trained model.
```

### Tasks that can be performed by `clinicadl`

There are five kind of tasks that can be performed using the command line:

- **Generate a synthetic dataset.** Useful to run functional tests.

- **T1 MRI preprocessing.** It processes a dataset of T1 images stored in BIDS
  format and prepares to extract the tensors (see paper for details on the
  preprocessing). Output is stored using the
  [CAPS](http://www.clinica.run/doc/CAPS/Introduction/) hierarchy.

- **T1 MRI tensor extraction.** The `extract` option allows to create files in
  Pytorch format (`.pt`) with different options: the complete MRI, 2D slices
  and/or 3D patches. This files are also stored in the CAPS hierarchy.

- **Train neural networks.** Tensors obtained are used to perform the training of CNN models.

- **MRI classification.** Previously trained models can be used to performe the inference of a particular or a set of MRI.

For detailed instructions and options of each task type  `clinica 'task' -h`.

### Some examples

#### Preprocessing
Typical use for `preprocessing`:

```bash
clinicadl preprocessing --np 32 \
  $BIDS_DIR \
  $CAPS_DIR \
  $TSV_FILE \
  $WORKING_DIR
```

#### Tensor extraction

These are the options available for the `extract` task:
```
usage: clinicadl extract [-h] [-psz PATCH_SIZE] [-ssz STRIDE_SIZE]
                         [-sd SLICE_DIRECTION] [-sm {original,rgb}]
                         [-np NPROC]
                         caps_dir tsv_file working_dir {slice,patch,whole}

positional arguments:
  caps_dir              Data using CAPS structure.
  tsv_file              tsv file with sujets/sessions to process.
  working_dir           Working directory to save temporary file.
  {slice,patch,whole}   Method used to extract features. Three options:
                        'slice' to get 2D slices from the MRI, 'patch' to get
                        3D volumetric patches or 'whole' to get the complete
                        MRI.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -psz PATCH_SIZE, --patch_size PATCH_SIZE
                        Patch size (only for 'patch' extraction) e.g:
                        --patch_size 50
  -ssz STRIDE_SIZE, --stride_size STRIDE_SIZE
                        Stride size (only for 'patch' extraction) e.g.:
                        --stride_size 50
  -sd SLICE_DIRECTION, --slice_direction SLICE_DIRECTION
                        Slice direction (only for 'slice' extraction). Three
                        options: '0' -> Sagittal plane, '1' -> Coronal plane
                        or '2' -> Axial plane
  -sm {original,rgb}, --slice_mode {original,rgb}
                        Slice mode (only for 'slice' extraction). Two options:
                        'original' to save one single channel (intensity),
                        'rgb' to saves three channel (with same intensity).
  -np NPROC, --nproc NPROC
                        Number of cores used for processing
```

## Run testing.

### Unit testing

Be sure to have the `pytest` library in order to run the test suite.  This test
suite includes unit testing to be launched using the command line: 
```
pytest clinicadl/tests/
```

### Model prediction tests

For sanity check trivial datasets can be generated to train or test/validate
the predictive models.

The follow command allow you to generate two kinds of synthetic datasets: fully
separable (trivial) or intractable data (IRM with random noise added). 
```
python clinicadl generate {random,trivial} caps_directory tsv_path output_directory
```
The intractable dataset will be made of noisy versions of the first image of
the tsv file given at 
`tsv_path` associated to random labels.

The trivial dataset includes two labels:
- AD corresponding to images with the left half of the brain with lower intensities,
- CN corresponding to images with the right half of the brain with lower intensities.
