### Train & test your classifier
- `clinicadl train` - [Train with your data and create a model](/Train/Introduction)
- `clinicadl classify` - [Classify one image or a list of images with your previously trained model](./Classify)

### Utilitaries <!--used for the preparation of imaging data and/or training your classifier-->

- `clinicadl generate` - [Generate synthetic data for functional tests](./Generate)
- `clinicadl tsvtool` - [Handle TSV files for metadata processing and data splits](./TSVTools)


## Pretrained models

Some of the pretained model for the CNN networks can be obtained here:
<https://zenodo.org/record/3491003>  

These models were obtained during the experiments for publication.
Updated versions of the models will be published soon.
