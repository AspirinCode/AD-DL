# `train` - Train deep learning networks for neuroimaging classification

This pipeline enables the training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier using different formats of inputs 
(whole 3D images, 3D patches or 2D slices), as defined in ([Wen et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101694)). 
It mainly relies on the PyTorch deep learning library 
([Paszke et al., 2019](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9015-pytorch-an-imperative-style-high-performance-deep-learning-library)).

## Prerequisites
You need to execute the [`clinicadl tsvtool getlabels`](../TSVTools.md#getlabels-extract-labels-specific-to-alzheimers-disease) 
and [`clinicadl tsvtool {split|kfold}`](../TSVTools.md#split-single-split-observing-similar-age-and-sex-distributions) pipelines
prior to running this pipeline to have the correct TSV file organization.
Moreover, there should be a CAPS, obtained running the `t1-linear` pipeline of ClinicaDL 
or the `t1-extensive` preprocessing pipeline of `clinicadl` (to be implemented).

## Running the pipeline
The pipeline can be run with the following command line:
```
clinicadl train <mode> <network_type> <caps_directory> \
                <preprocessing> <tsv_path> <output_directory> <architecture>
```
where mandatory arguments are:

- `mode` (str) is the type of input used. Must be chosen between `image`, `patch`, `roi` and `slice`.
- `network_type` (str) is the type of network used. 
The options depend on the type of input used, but at most it can be chosen between `autoencoder`, `cnn` and `multicnn`.
- `caps_directory` (str) is the input folder containing the neuroimaging data in a [CAPS](http://www.clinica.run/doc/CAPS/Introduction/) hierarchy.
- `preprocessing` (str) corresponds to the preprocessing pipeline whose outputs will be used for training. 
The current version only supports `t1-linear`, but `t1-extensive` will be implemented in next versions of `clinicadl`.
- `tsv_path` (str) is the input folder of a TSV file tree generated by `clinicadl tsvtool {split|kfold}`.
- `output_directory` (str) is the folder where the results are stored.
- `architecture` (str) is the name of the architecture used (e.g. `Conv5_FC3`). 
It must correspond to a class that inherits from `nn.Module` imported in `tools/deep_learning/models/__init__.py`.

Options shared among all pipelines are organized in groups:

- **Computational resources**
    - `--use_cpu` (bool) forces to use CPU. Default behaviour is to try to use a GPU and to raise an error if it is not found.
    - `--nproc` (int) is the number of workers used by the DataLoader. Default value: `2`.
    - `--batch_size` (int) is the size of the batch used in the DataLoader. Default value: `2`.
- **Data management**
    - `--diagnoses` (list of str) is the list of the labels that will be used for training. 
    These labels must be chosen from {AD,CN,MCI,sMCI,pMCI}. Default will use AD and CN labels.
    - `--baseline` (bool) is a flag to perform the load only _baseline.tsv files instead of .tsv files comprising all the sessions. Default: `False`.
    - `--unnormalize` (bool) is a flag to disable min-max normalization that is performed by default. Default: `False`.
- **Cross-validation arguments**
    - `--n_splits` (int) is a number of splits k to load in the case of a k-fold cross-validation. Default will load a single-split.
    - `--split` (list of int) is a subset of folds that will be used for training. By default all splits available are used. 
- **Optimization parameters**
    - `--epochs` (int) is the maximum number of epochs. Default: `20`.
    - `--learning_rate` (float) is the learning rate used to perform weights update. Default: `1e-4`.
    - `--weight_decay` (float) is the weight decay used by Adam optimizer. Default: `1e-4`.
    - `--dropout` (float) is the rate of dropout applied in dropout layers. Default will reproduce the dropout rates used in 
    ([Wen et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101694)).
    - `--patience` (int) is the number of epochs for early stopping patience. Default: `10`.
    - `--tolerance` (float) is the value used for early stopping tolerance. Default: `0`.
    - `--evaluation_steps` (int) gives the number of iterations to perform an evaluation internal to an epoch. 
    Default will only perform one evaluation at the end of each epoch.
    - `--accumulation_steps` (int) gives the number of iterations during which gradients are accumulated before performing the weights update. 
    This allows to virtually increase the size of the batch. Default: `1`.

!!! note
    Other pipeline options are highly dependent on the input and the type of network used. 
    Please refer to the corresponding sections for more information.

!!! tip
    Typing `clinicadl train {image|patch|roi|slice} --help` will show you the networks that are available for training in this category.

## Outputs

At the first level of the file system, all pipeline outputs are identical.
Below is an example of the output file system for a network trained with data split between train and validation sets 
corresponding to a 5-fold cross-validation.

<pre>
results
├── commandline.json
├── environment.txt
├── <b>fold-0</b>
├── <b>fold-1</b>
├── <b>fold-2</b>
├── <b>fold-3</b>
└── <b>fold-4</b>
</pre>

where:

- `commandline.json` is a file containing all the arguments necessary to reproduce the experiment,
- `environment.txt` contains the version of `python` and `pytorch` used to run the experiment,
- `fold-<i>` is a folder containing the result of the run on the `i`-th split of the 5-fold cross-validation.

!!! note
    A run of `clinicadl train` is necessarily associated to a TSV file system defining a series of data splits (k-fold cross-validation or single split). 
    In the case of a single split the `results` folder will only contain a folder named `fold-0`.

The structure of the `fold-<i>` folders partly depends on the type of network trained. They may contain the following folders:

- `models` is the folder containing checkpoints saved at the end of each epoch, 
as well as the best model according to a specific metric on the validation set. 
The selection of a best model is only performed at the end of an epoch (a model cannot be selected based on internal evaluations in an epoch).
- `tensorboard_logs` contains logs that can be visualized with [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard).
- `cnn_classification` *specific to `(multi)cnn`* contains TSV files corresponding to the evaluation of the best models as saved in `models`.
- `autoencoder_reconstruction` *specific to `autoencoder`* contains reconstructions of the best model selected on the validation loss.

## Implementation details

Some architectures were implemented in `clinicadl` and corresponds to the ones used in ([Wen et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101694)). 
These architectures present some specificites described here.

### Adaptive padding in pooling layers

Pooling layers reduce the size of their input feature maps. 
There are no learnable parameters in this layer, the kernel outputting the maximum value of the part of the feature map its kernels is covering.

Here is a 2D example of the standard layer of pytorch `nn.MaxPool2d`:

<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qh9M9r9mfpZeSD1VjOGQAl8zWqBLmcKz" style="height: 200px;" alt="animation of classical max pooling">

The last column may not be used depending on the size of the kernel/input and stride value. 
To avoid this, pooling layers with adaptive padding `PadMaxPool3d` were implemented in `clinicadl` to exploit information from the whole feature map.

!!! note
    To avoid this problem, deep learners often choose to resize their input to have sizes 
    equal to 2<sup>n</sup> with maxpooling layers of size and stride of 2.

### Autoencoders construction from CNN architectures

In `clinicadl`, an autoencoder is derived from a CNN architecture:

- the encoder corresponds to the convolutional part of the CNN,
- the decoder is composed of the transposed version of the operations used in the encoder.

![Transfer learning from autoencoders to CNNs](../images/transfer_learning.png)

The list of the transposed version of modules can be found below:

- `Conv3d` → `ConvTranspose3d`
- `PadMaxPool3d` → `CropMaxUnpool3d` 
(specific module of `clinicadl` used to reconstruct the feature map produced by pooling layers with adaptive padding)
- `MaxPool3d` → `MaxUnpool3d`
- `Linear` → `Linear` with an inversion in `in_features` and `out_features`,
- `Flatten` → `Reshape`
- `LeakyReLU` → `LeakyReLU` with the inverse value of alpha,
- other → copy of itself

## Implementation of a custom experiment

The aim of `clinicadl` is not to provide a collection of tools, but to allow users to add their own in the framework.
Before starting, please fork and clone the [github repo](https://github.com/aramis-lab/AD-DL]).

!!! tip
    Do not hesitate to ask for help on [GitHub](https://github.com/aramis-lab/AD-DL/issues/new) 
    or propose a new pull request!


### Custom architecture 

Custom CNN architectures can be added to clinicadl by adding a model class in `clinicadl/tools/deep_learning/models` 
and importing it in `clinicadl/tools/deep_learning/models/__init__.py`.

There are two rules to follow to convert this CNN architecture into an autoencoder:

1. Implement the convolutional part in `features` and the fully-connected layer in `classifier`. See predefined models as examples.
2. Check that all the modules used in your architecture are in the list of modules transposed by the autoencoder 
or that the invert version of this module is itself (it is the case for activation layers).

### Custom input type

Input types that are already provided in `clinicadl` are `image`, `patch`, `roi` and `slice`. To add a custom input type, 
please follow the steps detailed below:

- Choose a mode name for this input type (for example default ones are image, patch, roi and slice). 
- Add your dataset class in `clinicadl/tools/deep_learning/data.py` as a child class of the abstract class `MRIDataset`.
- Create your dataset in `return_dataset` by adding:
```
elif mode==<mode_name>:
    return <dataset_class>(
        input_dir,
        data_df,
        preprocessing=preprocessing,
        transformations=transformations,
        <custom_args>
    )
```
- Add your custom subparser to `train` and complete `train_func` in `clinicadl/cli.py`.

### Custom preprocessing
Define the path of your new preprocessing in the `_get_path` method of `MRIDataset` in `clinicadl/tools/deep_learning/data.py`. 

You will also have to add the name of your preprocessing pipeline in the general command line by modifying the possible choices 
of the `preprocessing` argument of `train_pos_group` in `cli.py`.

### Custom labels
You can launch a classification task with clinicadl using any labels. 
The input tsv files must include the columns `participant_id`, `session_id` and `diagnosis`. 

If the column `diagnosis` does not contain the labels described the 
[dedicated section](../TSVTools.md#getlabels-extract-labels-specific-to-alzheimers-disease) (AD, CN, MCI, sMCI or pMCI), 
you can add your own label name associated to a class value in the `diagnosis_code` of the class `MRIDataset` 
in `clinicadl/tools/deep_learning/data.py`.
